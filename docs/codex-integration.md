# Codex integration

This guide is for a local Codex user who wants VGXNESS-managed agent profiles while retaining ownership of Codex configuration. It applies to the standalone `integrate codex` lifecycle; there is no `setup codex` command and VGXNESS installs no Codex plugin.

## Prerequisites and ownership

Install VGXNESS and Codex locally. By default the integration uses `~/.codex`; use an absolute `--config-dir` to select another existing or creatable Codex root. VGXNESS owns only `AGENTS.md` and 14 files below `agents/`. It never parses, writes, or removes `config.toml`, including MCP blocks and other user settings.

Maintain this MCP block yourself in `config.toml` when you want Codex to invoke VGXNESS:

```toml
[mcp_servers.vgxness]
command = "vgxness"
args = ["mcp", "--full"]
```

The locally observed Codex 0.147.0 exposes top-level `--strict-config`, but `codex mcp` rejects that option. Validate the loaded configuration noninteractively with:

```sh
codex --strict-config doctor --summary --no-color --ascii
```

`doctor` may perform connectivity health checks. List the configured MCP servers separately with:

```sh
codex mcp list
```

For other versions, first confirm that `codex --help` lists `--strict-config`. Do not assume that option is available or run a bare interactive invocation.

## Lifecycle

Preview is read-only:

```sh
vgxness integrate codex preview
```

Install, inspect, repair an exact partial installation, and uninstall with:

```sh
vgxness integrate codex install --model-plan medium
vgxness integrate codex status
vgxness integrate codex reinstall --model-plan ultra
vgxness integrate codex uninstall
```

Use `--model-plan low|medium|high|ultra` with preview, install, status, or reinstall. A fresh no-flag install defaults to `medium`; once installed, no-flag install, reinstall, status, and uninstall infer and preserve the exact managed plan. Reinstall with a different explicit plan switches the 14 delegated profiles only when the existing package is an exact VGXNESS identity. The plan uses the normal `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-sol` models with role-specific reasoning effort; Codex does not accept OpenCode's custom slot flags. The primary manager is governed by `AGENTS.md`, so its model remains the model selected for the parent Codex task.

Use `--config-dir /absolute/path/to/.codex` with any command when needed. Status reports drift rather than overwriting changed managed bytes. Reinstall repairs an exact partial layout or switches an exact managed plan; drift or recovery evidence stops the operation. Uninstall removes only exact VGXNESS artifacts and leaves `config.toml`, plugins, and unrelated files untouched.

After install or repair, restart Codex so it reloads the managed profiles. On Windows, VGXNESS flushes regular files before publication; directory namespace durability is reported as `file-sync-namespace-best-effort` because Windows does not provide the POSIX directory-sync operation.
